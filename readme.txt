In these programs, we'll extract information of image and converting it into any other form using python's library "PILLOW".

According to the official pillow documentation, the mode of an image is a string that defines the type and depth of a pixel in the image. The pillow library supports 11 modes including the following standard modes:

~RGB (3x8-bit pixels, true color).
~RGBA (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask).
~CMYK (4x8-bit pixels, color separation).
~HSV (3x8-bit pixels, Hue, Saturation, Value color space).


Converting an image to PNG preserves any transparency while, Youâ€™ll lose any transparency in an image if you convert it to JPG format. For example, if you convert a transparent GIF image to a PNG image, the result will still be a transparent image.
If you try to preserve the transparency using the RGBA mode, Python will throw an error.
